Tail-call optimisation is where you are able to avoid allocating a new stack frame for a function because the calling function will simply return the value that it gets from the called function.

A function ends with a tail call if the last operation before the function returns is another function call. If this call invokes the same function, it is tail-recursive.

// A function can probably be optimised if itâ€™s last operation is calling itself
